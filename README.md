# React Studio

Use this stencil code to get started!

Make sure you're signed into your GitHub account (either real or anonymous is fine for this).

If you do not follow these three steps, your react app WILL NOT DEPLOY CORRECTLY!

1) Start to copy the stencil by clicking the green **"Use this template"** button above.

2) In the configuration menu, set the name to `react-studio` and **make it Public**

3) Lastly, you MUST **check "Include all branches"**

Then, click "create repository from template" to create the repo in your github account. You can now clone the repository onto your local computer and open it in your editor of choice.

## Getting started

First, make sure you install all dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

Then, in the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
